## Rain Drops 

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).*

**Raind Drops** is React/React Easy State App that uses OpenWeatherMap weather API to show current weather and 5 day forecast.

### Setup

Starting the app: 

```
npm install
npm start
```

You'll need API key for OpenWeatherMap and you can get one for free [here](https://openweathermap.org/api). Just add it to `.env` file (you'll probably need to create one) as REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_KEY and restart the server.
